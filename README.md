## MLAlgorithms - Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. The purpose of this repository is to provide a detailed explanation of how machine learning algorithms work and how they can be implemented in Python. The implementation of each algorithm is done using simple and understandable code. The algorithms are implemented using only the basic libraries in Python such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Notes:
- The test folder is actually implementation and visualization of the algorithms.
